Before you start setting up everything, I suggest using MinGW(since that's what I've been using)

I have prepared a shell script to copy everything that's needed, delete 
what you don't need and to get you up and going


Prerequisites:
C/C++ and MinGW (Microsoft) - Windows
CMake Tools (Microsoft) - Windows/Linux

/-------------------MinGW-----------------/
Install MinGW:https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download

Add to System PATH:

Press Win + R → type sysdm.cpl → Advanced → Environment Variables

Under System variables, edit Path → New

Add: C:\mingw64\bin

Click OK on all dialogs

Mark the packages from the picture

Installation -> Apply changes -> Apply
Restart VSCode 

Check if everything is installed correctly with: 
gcc --version

If you are having issues with gcc, or cmake:
export PATH=$PATH:/c/mingw64/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/c/cmake/bin
Make sure the paths are correct

/-------------------CMAKE--------------------/

Download:https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v4.1.0-rc1/cmake-4.1.0-rc1-windows-x86_64.msi

Restart VSCode 

Check if everything is installed correctly with: 
cmake --version


Linux(Debian based):
sudo apt install cmake

/----------------------FreeRTOS Set Up---------------------------/
Step 1:
(Assuming that you are in the root folder outside of simulation) 
mkdir freeRTOS_OS
git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git

The root folder should look as it follows:
- documents
- freeRTOS_OS(Name it like this, otherwise the scrips won't work well)
- simulation
- folder_setup.sh
- Setup.txt

And this is the correct path freeRTOS_OS/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS , freeRTOS_OS/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus


Step 2:
(freeRTOS_OS/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS)
go to Source and git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git
move all of the files from the "FreeRTOS-Kernel" to the folder above "Source".

It shouldn't be Source/FreeRTOS-Kernel/ . It should just be Source/ (files from FreeRTOS-Kernel without the extra folder) 
/----------------------FreeRTOS Set Up---------------------------/
